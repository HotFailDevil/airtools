===============
python-AIRtools
===============

Limited subset of P.C. Hansen and J. S. JÃ¸rgensen `AIRtools 1.0 <http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/AIRtoolsII/>`_ Matlab suite of inversion / regularization tools, along with some ReguTools functions.
Also includes linear constrained least squares solver using cvxopt in ``lsqlin.py``

We only converted the functions we needed, many more are available in Matlab from `AIRtools 2 <https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII>`_.

Install
=======
::

    python -m pip install -e .
    

Usage
=====
Just paste the code from each test into your console for the function you're interested in. 
Would you like to submit a pull request for an inversion example making a cool plot?

Examples
--------
See ``tests/test.py``. 


Tests
-----
You can run a comparison of the Python code with the Matlab code in the ``matlab/`` directory by::

    ./tests/test_octave.py
    
which runs the Matlab version via `Oct2Py <https://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/>`_.
